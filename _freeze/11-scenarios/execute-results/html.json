It allows you to explore and calculate different future situations (scenarios) without changing values in the worksheet.\n\nIn a scenario, you give some variable cells (known as **changing cells**) different values and calculate the effect of the changes on certain **result cells**. The result cells contain formulas with references to the changing cells.\n\nFor example, you might want to compare best-case and worst-case scenarios for the annual profit of a coffee shop, based on different costs. The result cell is the cell with the calculated profit. The changing cells are the cells with the costs.\n\nIdentifying the changing cells and result cells is key for creating scenarios.\n\nWith Excel's scenario manager, you can create different sets of input data that calculate the corresponding results. You can save such a scenario under an appropriate name (such as Most Positive, Most Negative, ...). You can easily compare the different results in a produced summary report. This report shows both the input values for the changing cells and the values of the result cells.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nIt is recommended to always save the current situation in a scenario, for example under the name [Current]{.varname}.\n:::\n\n## Coffee bar {#sec-scenarios-coffeebar}\n\nIn @fig-coffeebar-model, you see a calculation model of a coffee bar. The gray cells are the variable cells.\n\n![Calculation model for coffee bar.](images/scenarios/coffeebar-model.png){#fig-coffeebar-model}\n\nIn addition to the current situation, the owner of the coffee bar \"The Brown Bear\" wants to explore two other scenarios to see the effect on the profit.\n\nHigher prices, less salary and advertising\n: A scenario with 10% higher prices and less investment in salaries ($ 30,000 less) and advertising ($ 5,000 less) \n\nHigher prices, lower costs and more advertising\n: A scenario with 5% higher prices, 5% lower order costs and more advertising (â‚¬2000 more)\n\n::: {#prp-scenarios-coffeebar}\n[File]{.smallcaps}: `BrownBean.xlsx`\n\n1. Open the file.\n\nStudy the model. Identify the changing cells and the result cell. Study the used formulas and see that all cells have names.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nIf you give meaningful names to the cells then these names will be used in the summary report instead of the addresses. Then it will be easy to read the report.\n:::\n\n2. Choose [tab Data > What-If Analysis (group Forecast) > Scenario Manager]{.uicontrol}.\n\n![Dialog box Scenario Manager.](images/scenarios/scenario-manager.png){#fig-scenario-manager}\n\n3. Click [Add]{.uicontrol}.\n\n4. Fill in the dialog box as shown in @fig-coffeebar-scen-current. When specifying the [Changing cells]{.uicontrol}, use the [CTRL]{.uicontrol} key to select multiple areas. \n\n![Dialog box to record the current situation in a scenario.](images/scenarios/coffeebar-scen-current.png){#fig-coffeebar-scen-current}\n\n5. Click [OK]{.uicontrol}. The window ***Scenario Values*** appears with the values for the changing cells already entered.\n\n![Dialog box with the values of the changing cells for scenario Current.](images/scenarios/coffeebar-scen-current-values.png){#fig-coffeebar-scen-current-values}\n\n6. Click on [Add]{.uicontrol} for entering a new scenario.\n\n7. Give the scenario the name [Higher prices, less salary and advertising]{.varname}. Give it a brief description and click [OK]{.uicontrol}.\n\nThe Scenario Values dialog box appears, still showing the current values of the changing cells.\n\n8. Now type the new values in the cells that change for this scenario. Instead of calculating these values yourself, you can enter a formula. Excel automatically calculates the new value.\n\n   + Yield_per_Order: `=1.1*2.5`\n   + Salaries: `=300000-30000`\n   + Advertisement: `=20000-5000`\n\n9. Click [OK]{.uicontrol}.\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nWhen you have used formulas, a warning screen appears that the entered formulas will be replaced by the results of the formulas.\n\nConfirm with [OK]{.uicontrol}\n:::\n\n10. The same way, create another scenario with the name [Higher prices, less order costs and more advertising]{.varname} and adjust the values for this scenario.\n\nAfter the last scenario has been added, you will return to the ***Scenario Manager*** dialog which now contains three scenarios (@fig-coffeebar-scenarios). \n\n![Dialog box with the three scenarios.](images/scenarios/coffeebar-scenarios.png){#fig-coffeebar-scenarios}\n\n11. Now select each scenario one after the other and then click on [Show]{.uicontrol}.\n\nIn the worksheet, the values in the changing cells and the cells that depend on them are adjusted for the selected scenario. \n\n12. Click on [Summary]{.uicontrol} to create a report.\n\nA dialog box will appear (@fig-coffeebar-scen-reporttype) in which you can choose the type of summary. Also the result cell (the cell with the profit) has already been filled in by Excel.\n\n![Dialog box scenario summary.](images/scenarios/coffeebar-scen-reporttype.png){#fig-coffeebar-scen-reporttype}\n\n13. Click [OK]{.uicontrol}.\n\nA summary report will now appear in a new worksheet. Note that the left column contains the assigned cell names and not the addresses, making the report easier to read.\n\n![Summary report.](images/scenarios/coffeebar-scen-summary.png){#fig-coffeebar-scen-summary}\n\n:::\n\n## Exercises {#sec-scenarios-exercises}\n\n::: {#exr-scen001}\n**Profit margin - Sales price (scen001)**\n\nCreate the following table as accurate as possible. Use formulas for the determination of the margin, VAT, and the selling prices.\n\n![](images/scenarios/scen001-data.png)\n\nUse the Scenario Manager to determine the selling prices (incl. VAT) for successively the profit margin rates of 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30%.
