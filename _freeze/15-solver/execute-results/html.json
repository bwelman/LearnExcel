In such a calculation you want to find an optimal value for a formula in a certain cell, usually a minimum or a maximum and sometimes a very specific value.\n\nobjective cell, target cell\n\n:   This is the cell with a formula for which you want to find the optimal outcome.\n\nvariable cells, changing cells, decision variables\n\n:   These are the cells that determine the outcome of the formula. Changing the values also changes the outcome of the formula.\n\nconstraints, restrictions, preconditions\n\n:   These are restrictions that apply to the variable cells, they often cannot take all possible values and are bound by limits.\n\n::: callout-note\nSolver has more capabilities than Goal Seek to perform \"What-If\" analyzes and is much more versatile. Solver adjusts the values of the changing cells within the bounds of the boundary conditions to arrive at the optimal solution of the target cell.\n:::\n\n## Enabling Solver {#sec-solver-activation}\n\nThe Solver is an add-in and isn't activated by default through the menu of Excel. If the Solver is not present on the ribbon, then it has to be activated first. This is a one time action.\n\n::: callout-warning\nFirst, make sure that Solver is available on the ribbon. If so, you can skip this task. Select [Data tab]{.uicontrol}, check whether the [Analyze group]{.uicontrol} exists and if so whether the [Solver]{.uicontrol} is present.\n\n![Group Analayze with Sover on the ribbon.](images/solver/excel-ribbon-analyze.png){#fig-excel-ribbon-analyze}\n:::\n\n::: {#prp-solver-activation}\n\n1.

Repeat the check in the first step.\n\n:::\n\n## Defining an optimization model {#sec-solver-model}\n\nTo be able to perform an optimization calculation, you must first set up a suitable calculation model. That is usually much more difficult than using the Solver itself. Making such a model is explained on the basis of the WeatherLeather case.\n\n### Case description {#sec-solver-case-description}\n\nWeatherLeather, a manufacturer of expensive leather jackets, has two designs created for the new season, a long jacket and a short jacket. The manufacturing of a short jack requires 1 hour on the cutting department and 3 hours on the sewing department. A long jacket requires 2 hours and 4 hours respectively. The availability of labor hours in the cutting department and the sewing department is limited. The available capacity on the cutting department is 32 hours per week and on the sewing department 84 hours a week. The market demand for long leather jackets is limited. No more than 12 long leather jackets can be sold per week. For the short jackets, all jackets made can be sold. There is no production to stock. The profit for a short jacket is \\$90 and for a long jacket \\$144.\n\nHow many jackets must be made of each type per week to get the highest possible profit?\n\n### Understanding problem {#sec-solver-case-problem}\n\nThis step seems so obvious that maybe it seems hardly worth mentioning. It is important to pay attention a little bit more before starting with the formulation of the object cell, variable cells, and restrictions. If you do not fully understand the problem, you risk incorrect formulations of the model. The problem in this example is fairly simple:\n\nHow many short and long jackets do you need to produce weekly to get maximum profits, while no more than 32 hours cutting time and 84 hours sewing time is available?\n\n### Decision variables {#sec-solver-case-variables}\n\nDetermine the decision variables. These are variables you have determine a value that gives the optimal result. In the Excel model, these are the variable cells. In this example, there are two decision variables which are conveniently referred with a letter:\n\n-   $\\mathrm{S}$ = number of short jackets per week\n-   $\\mathrm{L}$ = number of long jackets per week\n\n### Objective function {#sec-solver-case-objective}\n\nYou must establish a formula with the optimal value as an outcome. The decision variables are included in this formula. In this example, the objective function is the profit per week and this depends on the number of produced short jackets ($\\mathrm{S}$) and long jackets ($\\mathrm{L}$):\n\n$\\mathrm{Profit = 90 \\times S + 144 \\times L}$ (This should be maximized.)\n\n::: callout-note\nIn more complex models, it is sometimes difficult to formulate the problem so that one goal function is obtained. It may happen that the decision variables are not directly in the objective function. In such case, the objective function contains variables whose values depend on the decision variables.\n:::\n\n### Constraints {#sec-solver-case-modelconstraints}\n\nUsually, there are restrictions for the values of the decision variables. These restrictions should be identified and formulated.\n\nIn this example, three restrictions that come straight from the case are the limited capabilities for the cutting and sewing department and the market demand for the long jackets.\n\nBesides, there are often general restrictions that have to do with the data type of the decision variables. In this example, the two decision variables, the number of produced jackets, must always have to be positive integers.\n\nThis leads to the formulation of the following restrictions:\n\n-   Restriction cutting time per week: $\\mathrm{1 \\times S + 2 \\times L \\le 32}$\n-   Restriction sewing time per week: $\\mathrm{3 \\times S + 4 \\times L \\le 84}$\n-   Restriction market demand long jackets: $\\mathrm{L \\le 12}$\n-   Restrictions positive values: $\\mathrm{S \\ge 0}$ and $\\mathrm{L \\ge 0}$\n-   Restrictions integer values: $\\mathrm{S = integer}$ and $\\mathrm{L = integer}$\n\n### Model in Excel {#sec-solver-case-model}\n\nTime to build the model in Excel and solve the problem with the Solver tool. One possible solution you can see in @fig-weatherleather-model.\n\n![Example of a calculation model WeatherLeather.](images/solver/weatherleather-model.png){#fig-weatherleather-model}\n\nThere is not one good way to build this model in Excel. There are just some guidelines. These guidelines are discussed based on @fig-weatherleather-model. You can, of course, build the model yourself using the guidelines and the figure, but it is also made available in the file `WeatherLeather.xlsx`.\n\n### Guidelines for a Solver model in Excel {#sec-solver-case-guidelines}\n\n1.  Organize the data in a logical and orderly manner and put sufficient explanatory text near the cells that contain numbers and formulas. A model is often used in reports later and then it has to be clear what everything is presenting and what it is all about. Highlight the cells with the decision variables (B4 and C4) and the object function (D5) so they are easily recognized. Put the restrictions in a separate part.\n\n2.  Put each decision variable in a separate cell and give them a starting value. In the example, the numbers of produced short and long jackets are respectively in cell B4 and cell C4. As starting value 1 is used in both cases. So you can at least verify the correctness of the formulas.\n\n3.  Create a formula for the object cell. In D5 the formula is `=B5*B4+C5*C4`.\n\n4.  Create a formula in a separate cell for each restriction. Put in the cell next to it the limit of the restriction.\n\n| cell | formula        | explanation                    |\n|------|----------------|--------------------------------|\n| D8   | `=B8*B4+C8*C4` | total cutting time calculation |\n| D9   | `=B9*B4+C9*C4` | total sewing time calculation  |\n| D10  | `=C4`          | number of long jackets         |\n\n: Formulas in the model. {#tbl-solver-model}\n\n### Solver Constraints {#sec-solver-case-solverconstraints}\n\nThe dialog box in Solver with which you add boundary conditions looks like in @fig-solver-constraint-add-general.\n\n![Dialog box for adding constraints.](images/solver/solver-constraint-add.png){#fig-solver-constraint-add-general}\n\nEvery constraint in the Solver consists of three parts: a cell reference, a relationship, and a constraint.\n\nCell Reference\n\n:   The cell address or name of the cell range whose values you want to constrain. You can use a single cell or a cell range, but not multiple ranges.\n\nRelationship\n\n:   Possible operators: `<=`, `=`, `>=`, `int`, `bin`, or `dif`.\n\n:   -   `int` is displayed as `integer` later in the model. The values in the cell references must then be integers, within a certain tight tolerance (defined with the Precise of boundary condition in the Solver options).\n\n:   -   `bin` will be displayed as `binary` later in the model. The values in the cell references must be either 0 or 1. You can therefore also use this option for \"yes/no\" decisions.\n\n:   -   `dif` will be displayed later in the model as `AllDifferent`. The values in all cell references must be different.\n\nConstraint\n\n:   A number, a cell reference, a name or a formula that needs to match.\n\n## Implementation model {#sec-solver-case-implementation}\n\nIn the case WeatherLeather, the profit must be maximized.\n\n::: {#prp-solver-case-implementation}\n[File]{.smallcaps}: `WeatherLeather.xlsx`\n\n1.  Open the file.\n\n2.  Select the object cell D5.\n\n3.  Choose [tab Data \\> Solver (group Analyze)]{.uicontrol}.\n\n![Parameters Solver.](images/solver/weatherleather-solver-parameters1.png){#fig-weatherleather-solver-parameters1}\n\n4.  Check the following:\n\n    -   [Set Objective]{.uicontrol}: `$D$5`\n    -   [To]{.uicontrol}: `Max`\n\n5.  Click in the box [By Changing Variable Cells]{.uicontrol} and select in the worksheet the cell range B4:C4. Excel converts this to `$B$4:$C$4`.\n\n6.  In the restrictions section, click [Add]{.uicontrol}. The ***Add constraint*** dialog box appears (see @fig-solver-constraint-add-general)\n\n7.  Add restriction `D8 <= E8` and click on [OK]{.uicontrol}.\n\nThe dialog box Solver Parameters appears again and Excel has the first restriction converted to `$D$8 <= $E$8`.\n\n8.  Click [Add]{.uicontrol}.\n\n9.  Add restriction `D9 <= E9` and now click on [Add]{.uicontrol}.\n\nNow the empty dialog box Add Constraint is displayed. You don't see now that Excel has added the second restriction.\n\n::: callout-note\nBy clicking on [Add]{.uicontrol} instead of [OK]{.uicontrol} you can add the restrictions easily without having to return to the Solver Parameters again.\n:::\n\n10. Add restriction `D10 <= E10` and click on [Add]{.uicontrol}.\n\n11. Add restriction `B4:C4 >= 0` and click on [Add]{.uicontrol}.\n\n12. Addt restriction `B4:C4 int`.\n\n13. All restrictions have been added. Click [OK]{.uicontrol}.\n\n![Solver parameters oplosser specified.](images/solver/weatherleather-solver-parameters2.png){#fig-weatherleather-solver-parameters2}\n\n14. Click on [Solve]{.uicontrol}. After a short time, the results pane of the Solver appears.\n\n![Solver results.](images/solver/solver-results-solution-dialogbox.png){#fig-solver-results-solution-dialogbox}\n\n15. Select [Keep Solver Solution]{.uicontrol} (default). Select [Answer (section Reports)]{.uicontrol} and then click [OK]{.uicontrol}.\n\nThe solution found by the Solver is now displayed in the worksheet.\n\n![Worksheet with a solution.](images/solver/weatherleather-solution.png){#fig-weatherleather-solution}\n\nAnd there has also been created a new worksheet with the name [Answer Report ...]{.uicontrol}.\n\n![Answer report for WeatherLeather.](images/solver/weatherleather-solver-report.png){#fig-weatherleather-solver-report}\n\n::: callout-note\n-   The names that are used in the report are not always accurate or clear. This is because Excel takes these names out of the text cells in the surrounding area. To ensure there are good names in the report, you first have to supply meaningful names to the relevant cells in the worksheet. This is highly recommended.\n\n-   At the section Constraints in the Answer Report you can see in the column Status which restrictions are Binding. If so, this indicates that the limit of the constraint is reached and there is no slack. In this example, you can see that all capacity for the cutting time and sewing time is used. For the long jackets, the limit for the market is not reached, there could be 6 more pieces sold.\n:::\n\nThe problem of WeatherLeather is now solved. A maximum profit of \\$ 2664 per week can be achieved by producing 20 short jackets and 6 long jackets.\n\n:::\n\n## No solution found. What now? {#sec-solver-problems}\n\nRegularly the Solver reports that no solution could be found:\n\n![Message that the solver has not found a viable solution.](images/solver/solver-results-nosolution-dialogbox.png){#fig-solver-results-nosolution-dialogbox}\n\nThere are two possibilities now:\n\n1.  There is no solution to the formulated problem.\n2.  There is a solution to the formulated problem, but it is not found by the Solver.\n\nIn most cases, you don't know with certainty which situation is present. There are a few guidelines to investigate whether the solution can be found by the Solver.\n\n### Changing start values variable cells {#sec-solver-startvalues}\n\nWhether it is possible for the Solver to find a solution or not depends on the starting values of the variable cells, among other things. Experimenting with different starting values can sometimes help to find a solution.\n\n### Changing Solver options {#sec-solver-options}\n\nFinding a solution also depends on how the Solver works. The search for a solution follows a so-called iterative process. An iteration is the repeated recalculation of a worksheet until a specific condition is met. The Solver has several settings for this iteration process. Clicking the button [Options]{.uicontrol} in the dialog box Solver Parameters displays a window for changing several options of the Solver.\n\n![Options solver.](images/solver/solver-options.png){#fig-solver-options}\n\nThe dialog box offers extensive possibilities for the solution process. Specifications for certain problems can be saved as a model and reloaded. A few of these settings are listed below and discussed shortly.\n\n| Option                 | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Max Time               | The maximum seconds the solver may spend at the iteration process.                                                                                                                                    |\n| Iterations             | The maximum number of iterations (recalculations).                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Precision              | The degree of precision for a constraint to be considered satisfied.

Supplying the stores is done from 3 distribution centers (DC) in Coevorden, Venlo, and Woerden. The stores make every week a sales forecast for the next week and submit the required number of products to the head office. The head office makes a transport planning to the shops based on the available stocks in the DC's and the required number of products.\n\n![](images/solver/solv008-model.png)\n\nExplanation:\n\n-   The upper table shows the transport costs per product unit from the DC to the store. So the cost of transport of 1 product from DC Coevorden to the store in Amersfoort is $100.\n-   In the column “Number Needed” is the number of products the store needs. So Amersfoort must receive 225 products.\n-   The area “Number transported from” should display the number of products that will be transported from the DC to the store. The Solver should determine these numbers..\n-   The row “Initial stock” contains the number of products that are in stock in the DC.\n\nCreate the cheapest transport planning using Solver.\n\n[File]{.smallcaps}: `Solv008.xlsx`\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html:js\"}\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Answer</button>\n\n![](images/solver/solv008-result.png)\n\n</div>\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {#exr-solv009}\n**Solving system of linear equations (solv009)**\n\nSolve the following system of equations using the Solver.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n  6,1x_1 + 4,5x_2 + 5,7x_4 + 7,5x_5 &= 5,7\\\\\n  2,4x_1 + 5,5x_2 - 5,7x_3 + 4,7x_4 + 5,6x_5 &= 5,6\\\\\n  2,4x_1 - 5,0x_2 - 4,6x_3 + 3,6x_4 + 9,7x_5 &= 9,7\\\\\n  4,3x_1 - 5,3x_2 + 3,4x_3 - 8,4x_4 - 5,6x_5 &= -5,6\\\\\n  1,1x_1 - 3,0x_2 + 2,4x_3 - 13x_4 + 3,5x_5 &= 3,5\n\\end{align*}\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html:js\"}\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Answer</button>\n\n![](images/solver/solv009-result.png)\n\n</div>\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {#exr-solv010}\n**Savings bank (solv010)**\n\nA savings bank has 3 million euros for investing.
