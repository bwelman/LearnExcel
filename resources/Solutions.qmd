## 06-functions

### form001 - Results computer company {-#sol-form001}

-   gross profit = revenues - costs
-   margin realized = gross profit / costs. Format as percentage with no decimals.
-   For the determination of the result, you should use the IF function. Because you had to test 2 conditions, a second IF must be embedded within the first IF. An alternative is to use the AND function inside the IF function.
    -   `=IF(D4>Target_Profit;IF(E4>Target_Margin;"good";"bad");"bad")`
    -   `=IF(AND(D4>Target_Profit;E4>Target_Margin);"good";"bad")`

-   `=IF(AND(Birthday<>"",Birthday<Expected),Expected-Birthday,"")`

The latest version has a slight preference because it is easier to read and understand.

Formula Days too late similar like before. A possible solution:

-   `=IF(AND(Birthday<>"";Birthday>Expected);Birthday-Expected;"")`

Formula on time similar like before. A possible solution:

-   `=IF(AND(Birthday<>"";Birthday=Expected);"yes";"")`

Formula overdue similar like before. A possible solution:

## 14-goalseek

### goal001 - Freelancer {-#sol-goal001}

Create two input cells: commission percentage and total sales. Calculate in another cell the commission amount with the formula `= commission_percentage * total_sales`.

Choose [tab Data > What-If Analysis (group Data Tools) > Goal Seek]{.uicontrol}.

The cell to set is the cell with the commission amount., to value 5000, by changing the cell with the total sales.

### goal002 - Loan payment {-#sol-goal002}

Create the model as shown in the figure. Formule in resultaatcel: `=PMT(annual_interest_rate /12,number_monthly_payments,borrowed_amount,0,1)`.

Because the payments are monthly you must specify the interest rate also per month. Hence the annual interest rate has to be divided by 12. The third argument is 0 after the final payment the loan has to be repaid. The fourth argument is 1 because the payment is made at the beginning of each month.

Choose [tab Data > What-If Analysis (group Data Tools) > Goal Seek]{.uicontrol}.

The cell to set is the result cell, to value -750, by changing the cell with the borrowed amount.

### goal003 - Break-even point {-#sol-goal003}

Create a table with different values for Q in the first column. Start with the value 0 with increments for example of 0.2 and finish with the value 16. So 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 ... Put formulas in the second column for calculating the values of TC and in the third column for calculating the values of TR.

In order to make estimates for the break-even points, you need a chart. Create a scatter chart and format the chart as shown.

A break-even point is the intersection of the two lines in the chart. As you can see in the chart there are two intersections, one for a Q-value between 0 and 1 and another one between 11 and 12.

Create a second table for the determination of the two break-even points. To find the intersection you need to calculate the difference of TC and TR because this difference is 0 for the intersection. Use as starting value 0 for the first point and 11 for the second point.

Choose [tab Data > What-If Analysis (group Data Tools) > Goal Seek]{.uicontrol}.

The cell to set is the cell with the result of TR-TC, to value 0, by changing the cell with the value for Q.

You need to perform Goal Seek twice, first for the calculation of point 1 and a second time for the calculation of point 2. The result is

![](exercises/images/goal003-breakeven.png)

### goal004 - Savings amount {-#sol-goal004}

Create a table as shown. Enter the years ​​in the first column. For year 2010, the cell for interest remains empty and for the value, you enter the formula: `= Deposit`.

Calculate for the year 2011 the interest with the formula `= Interest_per_year (abs. address) * Value_2010 (relative address)` and the value with the formule `= Value_2010 (rel. address) + Interest_2011 (rel. address)`. For the other years, you copy the two formulas for the year 2011 down.

Choose [tab Data > What-If Analysis (group Data Tools) > Goal Seek]{.uicontrol}.

The cell to set is the cell with the value for 2020, to 2500, by changing the cell with the Deposit.
