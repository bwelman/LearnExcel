## About the author {.unnumbered}

![Ben Welman](images/benw2.png){.quarto-cover-image .image-fluid width="150"}I studied Chemical Engineering at the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/). After first teaching chemistry and mathematics at secondary schools for a number of years, I started teaching informatics and statistics at [Saxion University of Applied Sciences](https://www.saxion.edu/). From there I switched internally to MeetingPoint, which was mainly involved in developing and supporting e-learning. In 1993 I founded [Softwijs](https://bwelman.github.io/softwijs/), which I stopped end 2018.

After my retirement I have time for my hobbies: billiards, bridge, brewing beer, baking bread and traveling (especially with camper and bike). In addition, besides making textbooks, I still have some time left to delve into data analysis, especially with [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) and less with [Python](https://www.python.org/).
