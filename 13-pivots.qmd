A PivotTable is a data summarization tool. It's an interactive dynamic table in which you can quickly and easily summarize, combine, and compare large amounts of data. It is necessary that the data is properly organized in a worksheet.

A pivot table is especially suitable when variables need to be plotted against other variables, allowing you to get answers to questions such as:

+ Which product makes the highest profit contribution?
+ Which salesman makes the highest turnover?
+ Which department incurs the most costs?
+ ...

::: {#exm-supermarket}
**Sales by category**

In the pivot table in @fig-supermarket-productcategory-town you can easily compare the turnover in the three product categories. 

![Example of a pivot table in which product category is plotted against location.](images/pivots/supermarket-productcategory-town.png){#fig-supermarket-productcategory-town}

A pivot table plots at least two types of data against each other. One data type goes in the column field, here [productcategory]{.varname}, the other in the row field, here [town]{.varname}. In addition, a data type whose results you want to see must be placed in the value field, here [Sales]{.varname}.

Because these results are summarized, it is also necessary to indicate which calculation should be used, here `Sum`, the default choice. 

:::

A PivotTable has four areas in which you can place fields:

|Area   |Description                                                                                                   |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Values |The fields with numeric information you want to summarize, usually for the calculation of totals and averages.|
|Rows   |These fields are used to create separate groups and put the information for each group in a separate row.|
|Columns|These fields are also used to create separate groups. Mostly used if you want to subdivide the data into the rows. These groups are displayed in separate columns. Take fields with not too many groups, otherwise, the table will come too wide.|
|Filters|These fields can be used for filtering the data.|

## Creating PivotTables {#sec-pivots-creating}

The file for this task contains the monthly sales in 2016 of three supermarkets for different products, see @fig-supermarket-sales-data. These products are divided into three product groups: pvf (potatoes, vegetables, fruit), meat and dairy. This data is analyzed using a pivot table. 

![Table with sales data.](images/pivots/supermarket-sales-data.png){#fig-supermarket-sales-data}

**Information need**: What are the total sales per town per productcategory?.

::: {#prp-pivots-creating}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Supermarket.xlsx`

1. Open the file.

2. Select any cell in the table. Choose [tab Insert > PivotTable (group Tables) > From Table/Range]{.uicontrol}.

The dialog box Create PivotTable appears. The range of the table has already filled in.

![Selecting data range for the pivottable.](images/pivots/supermarket-pivot-create.png){#fig-supermarket-pivot-create}

3. In this task, the PivotTable should appear in the existing worksheet. [Select Existing Worksheet]{.uicontrol} and click on an empty cell in the worksheet, e.g. cell G3.

![Specifying place for the pivottable.](images/pivots/pivottable-location.png){#fig-pivottable-location}

4. Click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

An empty PivotTable is created on the worksheet and a task pane appears on the right side with the PivotTable fields in which you can add fields to the report.

::: callout-note
The task panel with the field list will be shown when a cell in the PivotTable is the active cell. As soon as you click on a cell outside the PivotTable, the task panel disappears. The panel appears again when you click on any cell within the PivotTable.
:::

5. Drag in the task panel field [town]{.varname} to the area [Rows]{.uicontrol}, field [productcategory]{.varname} to the area [Columns]{.uicontrol}, and field [sales]{.varname} to the area [Values]{.uicontrol}. At the last action, the calculation method `Sum` of the Sales is applied automatically.

![Used fields for the PivotTable.](images/pivots/supermarket-productcategory-town-fields.png){#fig-supermarket-productcategory-town-fields}

::: callout-note
You can delete a field from the PivotTable by dragging it out of the area.
:::

The PivotTable in the worksheet is filled with the data.

![PivotTable report with two row fields.](images/pivots/supermarket-cat-products-town.png){#fig-supermarket-cat-products-town}

Instead of total sales you can also calculate other values, for example, the average monthly sales.

2. Select any numeric value in the PivotTable and change through the [Field Settings]{.uicontrol}, see @fig-supermarket-pivot-fieldsettings, the calculation type in `Average`.

:::

::: {#prp-pivots-top3}
**Top 3 products**

Now try to answer the following question using pivot tables:

Which three products generate the most sales?

::: {.content-visible when-format="html:js"}
`r hide("Hint")`
Use [product]{.varname} as row variabele. There is no column variable in this case. In the pivot table report, sort revenue from highest to lowest.

![](images/pivots/supermarket-products.png)
`r unhide()`
:::

:::

## Finding Data Sources {#sec-pivots-datasources}

A PivotTable contains summarized data. In this task, you learn how to find the source of these data.

In a worksheet are some data of employees like sales, expenses, and provision per month and per region. A PivotTable with the sales per region per employee has been created in another worksheet.

![Sales per region per employee.](images/pivots/sales-pivot.png){#fig-sales-pivot}

If you want the individual values a result is provided, Excel can show you this quickly and easily. By double-clicking on a result, Excel creates a new worksheet containing a table with the source data.

::: {#prp-pivots-datasources}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Sales.xlsx`

1. Open the file.

2. Select the worksheet PivotTable and double-click on the results of [Jansen]{.uicontrol} in the region [East]{.uicontrol}.

A new worksheet with a list of all information about Jansen in the region East is created.

![Data for Jansen in the region east.](images/pivots/sales-pivot-datasource.png){#fig-sales-pivot-datasource}

:::

## Grouping data {#sec-pivots-grouping-data}

You can make a cluttered list of data more suitable for analysis by grouping the data. This is especially the case when the data contains dates. Dates can often be grouped into years, quarters or months. In a pivot table you can view the data per year, per quarter or per month.

::: {#exm-grouping-data}
**Revenue per salesperson**

@fig-invoices-ungrouped-grouped shows part of a pivot table showing revenue per salesperson. In the left image the revenue is in date order (ungrouped). In the right image the revenue is grouped by quarter and by month.

![Revenue per salesperson. Ungrouped in the left figure, grouped in the right figure.](images/pivots/invoices-ungrouped-grouped.png){#fig-invoices-ungrouped-grouped}

:::

As of version 2016 Excel has the function **time grouping**. Automatically discovers and groups time-related fields. When adding such a field to a pivot table, new relevant fields are automatically created, such as [Years]{.varname}, [Quarters]{.varname} and [Months]{.varname}.

Which date/time fields are added depends on the level of detail of the date/time field in the data table. For example, if the date data is in days and spans more than a year, additional fields are created for months, quarters, and years.

Once the fields have been added you can start analyzing the data over the different time periods with zoom-in options. This way you can sometimes find extra insights.

::: {#exm-grouping-data2}
**quarterly comparison by year**

For example, to get a quarterly comparison over several years you can place the field [Years]{.varname} in the box [Columns]{.uicontrol} and the field [Quarters]{.varname} in the box [Rows]{.uicontrol }.

The [+]{.uicontrol} button in the pivot table indicates a collapsed level. When you click on this, all elements in the pivot table are expanded to the next level, here [Months]{.varname}. The [+]{.uicontrol} button then changes into a [-]{.uicontrol} button that allows you to collapse the group again. This is also known as **zoom in** or [drill-down]{.term}.

![Sales per quarter per year.](images/pivots/invoices-quarters-years.png){#fig-invoices-quarters-years}

:::

Custom grouping
: You can adjust the grouping by right-clicking on a date/time field in the pivot table and then choosing [Group]{.uicontrol}. In the Grouping dialog box that appears, you can add or remove other time levels.

Ungroup
: You can cancel a group by right-clicking on a grouped field in the pivot table and then choosing [Ungroup]{.uicontrol}.

## Grouping Example {#sec-pivots-grouping-example}

An example of grouping data based on a date field.

::: {#prp-pivots-grouping-example}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Invoices.xlsx`

1. Open the file.

The file contains a data table named [SalesData]{.varname} and columns [Region]{.varname}, [Salesman]{.varname}, [InvoiceNr]{.varname}, [InvoiceDate]{.varname}, [ProductCategory]{.varname}, and [InvoiceAmount]{.varname}.

First, a PivotTable with the sales per salesman per product category is created.

2. Select any cell in the table. Choose [tab Insert > PivotTable (group Tables)]{.uicontrol}.

![Specify data range and location of the PivotTable.](images/pivots/invoices-pivot-create.png){#fig-invoices-pivot-create}

::: callout-note
+ Since the data area here is a table called [Sales Dates]{.varname}, this name is automatically filled in and not the cell addresses.

+ To have the pivot table appear on a new worksheet, accept the default option [New Worksheet]{.uicontrol}.
:::

3. Click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

4. Create a pivot table according to the design in @fig-invoices-pivot-design and give the amounts a currency format. The result can be seen in @fig-invoices-sales-salesman. 

![Design PivotTable.](images/pivots/invoices-pivot-design.png){#fig-invoices-pivot-design}

![Sales per salesman per productcategory. Note that there are big differences by seller.](images/pivots/invoices-sales-salesman.png){#fig-invoices-sales-salesman}

5. Drag field [InvoiceDate]{.varname} to the area [Rows]{.uicontrol} and below field [Salesman]{.varname}. Excel's automatic time grouping feature creates two calculated fields, [Years]{.varname} and [Quarters]{.varname} in the [Rows]{.uicontrol} area.

![Adding Invoice Date automatically creates the Quarters and Years fields.](images/pivots/invoices-pivot-datefields.png){#fig-invoices-pivot-datefields}

In the PivotTable,  @fig-invoices-sales-grouped, the sales are now grouped per year. This also shows that Brown started as a seller in 2011 and not in 2010, which could be a possible explanation for the lower amounts.

![Sales per seller per productcategory, grouped by year.](images/pivots/invoices-sales-grouped.png){#fig-invoices-sales-grouped}

6. Click on the [+]{.uicontrol} (plus) button on any seller for the year 2010. This will expand the year to quarters for all sellers.

7. Click the [+]{.uicontrol} (plus) button for Qrt1 at any seller. As a result, the quarter is unfolded to the months for all sellers.

![Expanded levels for Year 2010 and Quarter 1.](images/pivots/invoices-pivot-drilldown.png){#fig-invoices-pivot-drilldown}

8. Experiment with unfolding and folding levels again.

9. Drag field [Product Category]{.varname} out of the [Columns]{.uicontrol} box, field [Quarters]{.varname} from [Rows]{.uicontrol} to  [Columns]{.uicontrol} and the fields  [Years]{.varname} and [Invoice Date]{.varname} out of the [Rows]{.uicontrol}. The design will now look like @fig-invoices-pivot-quarters. The result can be seen in @fig-invoices-sales-salesman-quarter. 

![Design PivotTable for sales per salesman per quarter.](images/pivots/invoices-pivot-quarters.png){#fig-invoices-pivot-quarters}

![Sales per salesman per quarter.](images/pivots/invoices-sales-salesman-quarter.png){#fig-invoices-sales-salesman-quarter}

To easily compare values you can also choose for displaying percentages (of row total, column total ,or grand total).

10. Select a numeric value in the PivotTable and choose [tab PivotTable Analyze > Field Settings (group Active Field)]{.uicontrol}. In the dialog box select tab [Show values As]{.uicontrol} and select [% of Row Total]{.uicontrol}.

![Setting values as percentages of row total.](images/pivots/invoices-fieldsettings-pct-rowtotal.png){#fig-invoices-fieldsettings-pct-rowtotal}

11. Click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

![Percentage sales per salesman per quarter.](images/pivots/invoices-sales-salesman-quarter-pct.png){#fig-invoices-sales-salesman-quarter-pct}

12, Then display the values as [% of Column Total]{.uicontrol}. 

:::

**Questions**

Use the PivotTable possibilities to answer the following questions. There are multiple ways to find the answers.

1. Which seller sold the most in December 2010?

::: {.content-visible when-format="html:js"}
Seller `r mcq(c("Anderson","Brown", "Gonzalez", "Hernandez", "Johnson", "King", "Lewis", "Miller", answer="Phillips", "Smith", "Williams"))`
:::

2. In which month of which year were software sales the highest?

::: {.content-visible when-format="html:js"}
Year `r mcq(c(2010, answer=2011))` Month `r mcq(c(answer="jan", "feb", "mat", "apr", "may", "jun", "jul", "aug", "sep", "oct", "nov", "dec"))`
:::

3. View hardware and software sales percentages by region. What is the percentage for software in the South region?

::: {.content-visible when-format="html:js"}
Rounded to whole number: `r fitb(answer = c(46, 47), num=TRUE)`
:::

4. What quarter of what year were Anderson's sales lowest?

::: {.content-visible when-format="html:js"}
Year `r mcq(c(2010, answer=2011))` Quarter `r mcq(c(1, 2, answer=3, 4))`
:::

5. Check out Brown's sales in Q2 2011. Do you notice something special?

::: {.content-visible when-format="html:js"}
`r hide("Answer")`
Only turnover in the month of June. Nothing in April and May.
`r unhide()`
:::

## Filtering {#sec-pivots-filters}

To filter the data in a pivot table, you can place a field (or more fields) in the [Filters]{.uicontrol} box in the task window. But when you filter on multiple items, you can't easily see what you're filtering on.

A more user-friendly way is using **slicers**. These contain a number of buttons that allow you to quickly filter the data in a pivot table. And just for filtering time data you can also use **timelines**, which are identical to slicers. 

You see the use of slicers and timelines a lot in so-called dashboards because you can link them to multiple pivot tables and pivot charts.

Three subtasks discuss creating report filters, slicers, and timelines. The file [Supermarket.xlsx` is used for this, the same file as in @sec-pivots-creating, which contains the monthly sales data in 2016 of a number of products, which are classified in three product groups: pvf (potatoes, vegetables, and fruits), meat and dairy. 

### Report filters {#sec-pivots-reportfilters}

::: {#prp-pivots-reportfilters}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Supermarket.xlsx`

1. Open the file.

2. Insert a pivot table for the data on a new worksheet.

3. Place the [productcategory]{.varname} field in [Columns]{.uicontrol}, the [sales]{.varname} field in [Values]{.uicontrol} and the [date]{.varname} field in [Rows]{.uicontrol}. 

::: callout-note
Excel's automatic time grouping adds the calculated field Months to the [Rows]{.uicontrol}. No other fields like quarters and years are added because all dates are only the last day of the month in one year. 
:::

4. Drag the [date]{.varname} field from [Rows]{.uicontrol} so that it only shows the [Months]{.varname} field. 

5. Place the [town]{.varname} field in the [Filters]{.uicontrol} box. This will create a report filter in the pivot table. 

![PivotTable report with a filter for town. By default, all values are shown.](images/pivots/supermarket-reportfilter-all.png){#fig-supermarket-reportfilter-all}

6. Click the drop-down arrow and select `Amsterdam`.


![PivotTable report with the data filtered by the city of Amsterdam. You can see that the data has been filtered by the filter symbol.](images/pivots/supermarket-reportfilter-amsterdam.png){#fig-supermarket-reportfilter-amsterdam}

7. Click the drop-down arrow, check the box [Select Multiple items]{.uicontrol} and then select `Amsterdam` and `Rotterdam`.

The data for both towns is displayed. Unfortunately, the filter only indicates that multiple items are selected, but not which items. For this scenario, slicers are a better alternative.

![PivotTable report with the data filtered on multiple towns. You can only see which ones they are by clicking on the selection arrow .](images/pivots/supermarket-reportfilter-multiple.png){#fig-supermarket-reportfilter-multiple}

8. Click the drop-down arrow and re-select the [(All)]{.uicontrol} option.

9. Remove the [town]{.varname} field from the [Filters]{.uicontrol} box.

:::

### Slicers {#sec-pivots-slicers}

::: {#prp-pivots-slicers}
Continue with the file from @prp-pivots-reportfilters.

1. Right-click on field [town]{.varname} in the PivotTable field list and select [Add as Slicer]{.uicontrol}.

And a slicer is created in the worksheet.

![Slicer for field town.](images/pivots/supermarket-slicer-town.png){#fig-supermarket-slicer-town}

2. Experiment with the slicer by selecting an item. You can select multiple items with the use of the [Ctrl]{.uicontrol} key or the ![Button select multiple items](images/pivots/slicer-button-multiple-items.png) button.

Another way to create slicers is through the menu. This way you can add multiple slicers at once.

3. Click anywhere in the PivotTable report and choose [tab PivotTable Analyze > Insert Slicer (group Filter)]{.uicontrol}.

![Insert slicers dialog box.](images/pivots/slicer-insert-dialogbox.png){#fig-slicer-insert-dialogbox}

4. Select [Months]{.varname} and click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

With tab [Slicer]{.uicontrol} on the ribbon, you can format a slicer such as change their look, settings, colors, ...

5. Experiment with filtering the data with the two slicers.

6. Delete all slicers by first selecting a slicer and then pressing the [Delete]{.uicontrol} key. 

:::

### Time lines {#sec-pivots-timelines}

Timelines are like slicers. They also allow you to filter data but they are specific for use with date/time fields. The dates appear in a horizontal line from oldest to newest as you move from left to right on the timeline. 

::: {#prp-pivots-timelines}
Continue with the file from @prp-pivots-slicers.

1. Click anywhere in the PivotTable report and choose [tab PivotTable Analyze > Insert Timeline (group Filter)]{.uicontrol}.

The ***Insert Timeline*** dialog box only shows the [date]{.varname} field because it is the only date/time field.

2. Select [date]{.varname} and click [OK]{.uicontrol}.

::: callout-note

![Timeline for field date.](images/pivots/supermarket-timeline-months.png){#fig-supermarket-timeline-months}

+ A scroll bar for the visible period.
+ Handles to select the period to filter on.
+ Choice of the time period to be displayed (Years, Quarters, Months, Days).
+ When you select a timeline you get handles on the edges with which you can make the area bigger/smaller.
:::

3. Select some months to see the results.

4. Click on the period selector in the upper right corner and select [Quarters]{.uicontrol}.

![Timeline with quarters.](images/pivots/supermarket-timeline-quarters.png){#fig-supermarket-timeline-quarters}

5. Select some quarters to see the results.

6. Delete the timeline by selecting it and then pressing the [Delete]{.uicontrol} key.

:::

## Pivot Charts {#sec-pivots-charts}

A PivotChart shows data series, categories, and chart axes the same way a standard chart does. But it also gives you interactive filtering so you can quickly analyze a subset of your data. And you can use slicers for filtering data.

::: {#prp-pivots-charts}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Sales.xlsx`

1. Open the file.

2. Select worksheet [PivotTable]{.varname} and then select any cell in the PivotTable on this worksheet.

3. Choose [tab Insert > PivotChart (group Charts) > Clustered Column > OK]{.uicontrol}.

![Column chart, linked to a pivot table.](images/pivots/sales-chart-clustered-column.png){#fig-sales-chart-clustered-column}

The PivotChart has filters for [Region]{.varname} and [Salesman]{.varname}. When you use a filter in the chart, then also the data in the PivotTable will be filtered.

4. Experiment with filtering on a salesman and observe the results. End with displaying the data for all salesman.

5. Add a slicer for [Month]{.varname} and experiment with it.

:::

## PivotTables Options {#sec-pivots-options}

There are various setting options for pivot tables. To do this, choose any cell in a PivotTable and then [PivotTable Analyze tab > Options (PivotTable group)]{.uicontrol}. You have several setting options via tabs (see below).

![Layout & Format options.](images/pivots/pivottable-options-layout-format.png){#fig-pivottable-options-layout-format}

![Totals & Filters options.](images/pivots/pivottable-options-totals-filter.png){#fig-pivottable-options-totals-filter}
