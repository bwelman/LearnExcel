**OBJECTIVES**

-   Chart types.
-   Line chart vs Scatter chart.
:::

Charts are used to visualize data and to compare numbers easily. Excel has a wide variety of chart types. Which type can best be used in which situation is not discussed here.

Despite a large number of chart types, there are essentially only a limited number of basic types.

![Basic chart types.](images/charttypes/charttype-basic.png){#fig-charttype-basic}

All these basic types have many variants so you can get confused quickly at first. It is important to choose a good chart type for visualizing the data. Ask yourself questions like:

-   What should the chart tell?
-   What facts are being compared?

## Column Chart {#sec-charttype-column}

If time units like years, quarters, months, weeks, and days are part of the data, then column charts are the most suitable type. Don't use too many data points. Five to six values are maximum. When you have more than 6 values on the horizontal axis then it is better to choose a line chart.

@fig-column-data shows the market shares for some supermarket chains for the years 2012-2016 in the Netherlands (source: Distrifood).

![Market shares for some supermarket chains in 2012-2016.](images/charttypes/column-data.png){#fig-column-data}

This data should be displayed in a column chart as shown in @fig-column-result.

![Column chart of market shares for some supermarket chains.](images/charttypes/column-result.png){#fig-column-result}

7.  Select text, [right mouse click \> Font \> tab Font \> Size 9 \> OK]{.uicontrol}.
:::

## Bar Chart {#sec-charttype-bar}

Bar charts are widely used to make clear differences in ranking. The importance (priority) of certain matters at the same moment can be expressed.

The results are usually sorted from highest to lowest, so the highest result is displayed as the first bar.

Figure shows the percentage of smokers by age group in 2009 (source: CBS).

![Percentage smokers in 2009.](images/charttypes/bar-data.png){#fig-bar-data}

The data should be displayed in a bar chart as shown in @fig-bar-result.

7.  Change chart title in `Percentage Smokers in 2009`.
:::

## Pie Chart {#sec-charttype-pie}

Pie charts are mainly used for displaying the percentage distribution of data within a group, such as election results. Too much information can make a pie chart cluttered. To keep it clear you should have at most 6 or 7 sectors in a pie chart.

150 pupils have been asked what their favorite pet is. @tbl-survey-pet displays the results.

| Pet    | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| Cats   | 70        |
| Dogs   | 38        |
| Birds  | 22        |
| Fish   | 13        |
| Others | 7         |

: Favorite pet survey results. {#tbl-survey-pet}

The data should be displayed in a pie chart, as shown in figure.

## Line Chart {#sec-charttype-line}

You use a line chart to visualize a trend in data over intervals of time. For line charts, the time unit is plotted along the horizontal axis, the category axis. The measured variable is plotted along the vertical axis. A line can be drawn between the points on the graph to visualize a trend in data over intervals of time.

In @fig-line-data, you can find annual temperature data (^o^C) for Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (source: <https://en.tutiempo.net/climate/ws-62400.html>).

-   T = Average annual temperature
-   Tmax = Annual average maximum temperature
-   Tmin = Average annual minimum temperature

![Average annual temperature Amsterdam, airport Schiphol.](images/charttypes/line-data.png){#fig-line-data}

The data is to be displayed in a line chart, as shown in @fig-line-result.

![Line chart with average annual temperature for Schiphol.](images/charttypes/line-result.png){#fig-line-result}

    -   Vertical axis title: `Temperature (C)`.

5.  Select the chart and change the style through [Chart Design \> Chart Styles]{.uicontrol}. Choose a style you like.
:::

## Scatter (XY) Chart {#sec-charttype-scatter}

A scatter chart (XY diagram) is very suitable if you want to analyze and show the relationship between two numeric variables. It also allows you to determine a trend line. In the chart, the values of two numeric variables are plotted against each other. Each pair makes a point in the chart.

To investigate whether there is a relationship between body length and weight, the data is measured for 10 students. The measurement data is shown in @fig-scatter-data.

![Investigation body length - weight.](images/charttypes/scatter-data.png){#fig-scatter-data}

The data should be displayed in a scatter chart, as shown in @fig-scatter-result.

## Doughnut Chart {#sec-charttype-doughnut}

A doughnut chart is an extension of the pie chart. This diagram can contain one or more rings and each ring represents a data series. A doughnut chart can be used if you want to show the percentage distribution of multiple data series.

In @fig-doughnut-data, the quarterly sales of a company are shown for the years 2008 and 2009.

![Sales by quarter.](images/charttypes/doughnut-data.png){#fig-doughnut-data}

These data should be displayed in a doughnut chart, as shown in @fig-doughnut-result.

![Doughnut chart sales by quarter.](images/charttypes/doughnut-result.png){#fig-doughnut-result}

::: {#prp-charttype-doughnut}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Chart_Doughnut.xlsx`

1.  Open the file.

2.  Select any cell in the data area.

3.  Choose [Insert \> Insert Pie or Doughnut Chart (group Charts) \> Doughnut]{.uicontrol}.

There are still some adjustments to be made. Some of the formatting in this example will be done by applying a predefined chart style.

4.  Change the chart title in `Sales 2008-2009 by quarter`.

5.  Select the chart and change the style through [Chart Design \> Chart Styles]{.uicontrol}. Choose a style you like.
:::

## Area Chart {#sec-charttype-area}

Area charts are based on line charts. The area between axis and line are commonly emphasized with colors or hatchings. As with a line chart, the size of a variable is plotted against time. In a stacked area chart multiple data series are placed one above the other, so the sum of the data can be seen. With an area chart can you make trends visible.

A company sells three products: A, B, and C. In @fig-area-data the sales quantity during the first half-year is shown.

![Sales quantities by month.](images/charttypes/area-data.png){#fig-area-data}

The data is to be displayed in a stacked area chart, as shown in @fig-area-result.

![Stacked area chart for sales quantities by month.](images/charttypes/area-result.png){#fig-area-result}

::: {#prp-charttype-area}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Chart_Area.xlsx`

1.  Open the file.

2.  Select any cell in the data area.

3.  Choose [Insert \> Recommended Charts (group Charts) \> Stacked Area \> OK]{.uicontrol}.

4.  Change the chart title in `Number of items sold`.

5.  Select legend, then right-click and [Format legend]{.uicontrol}. Change the position of the legend from [Bottom]{.uicontrol} to [Right]{.uicontrol}.

## Bubble Chart {#sec-charttype-bubble}

A bubble chart can be used if you want to display the relationship between three numeric variables.

A bubble chart is an extension of a scatter chart. In a scatter chart two numeric variables (X and Y) are plotted against each other. At a bubble chart, a third variable (Z) is used. The point in the scatter chart is now replaced by a bubble (or circle). The center of the bubble is determined by the variable X and Y and the size (radius) of the bubble by the variable Z. Other characteristics of the bubble, like the color, can also be used to make additional differences. These differences are based on qualitative, non-numeric values.

@fig-bubble-data shows how the market share is related to turnover and the number of products.

![Market shares.](images/charttypes/bubble-data.png){#fig-bubble-data}

The data is to be displayed in a bubble area chart, as shown in @fig-bubble-result.

![Bubble chart for market shares.](images/charttypes/bubble-result.png){#fig-bubble-result}

::: {#prp-charttype-bubble}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Chart_Bubble.xlsx`

1.  Open the file.

2.  Give the values for turnover and market share a proper format.

::: callout-note
A good layout of the source data ensures that you also get a good format in the chart.
:::

3.  Select any cell in the data area.

4.  Choose [Insert \> Insert Scatter (XY) or Bubble Chart (group Charts) \> 3-D Bubble]{.uicontrol}.

5.  Make the following changes:

    -   Chart title: `Market shares`
    -   Horizontal axis title: `Number of products`
    -   Vertical axis title: `Turnover`
    -   Scaling vertical axis: 0 to 70000 (set minimum on fixed 0 and maximum on fixed 70000)
    -   Color bubbles: orange/golden
    -   Data labels: position centered, display percentage of market share

The added data labels are not the ones you want. By default, the Y value (in this case, the revenue) is displayed. This must be changed to the bubble size, which in this case is determined by the market share.

6.  Select at [Label Contains]{.uicontrol} only [Bubble Size]{.uicontrol}.\

## Radar Chart {#sec-charttype-radar}

In a radar chart, multiple data series (categories) are plotted along separate axes starting from a point in the middle, the origin. The diagram looks like a spider web and is therefore called a spider chart or star chart. The angles between these axes are equal. The data points on the axes are usually connected with a line.

In @fig-radar-data, you see the scores of a self-evaluation, according to a 5-point Likert scale.

![Self-evaluation on a 1-5 scale.](images/charttypes/radar-data.png){#fig-radar-data}

The data should be displayed in a radar chart, as shown in @fig-radar-result.

![Radar chart self-evaluation.](images/charttypes/radar-result.png){#fig-radar-result}

::: {#prp-charttype-radar}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Chart_Radar.xlsx`

1.  Open the file.

2.  Select any cell in the data area.

3.  Choose [Insert \> Insert Surface or Radar Chart (group Charts) \> Radar]{.uicontrol}.

4.  Change the chart title in `Self-evaluation`.
:::

## Pareto chart {#sec-charttype-pareto}

A Pareto chart is a combination of a column chart and a line chart. For the column chart, the values are sorted from largest to smallest. The line chart is on top of the columns and shows the cumulative percentage. The column chart uses the normal Y-axis on the left. For the line chart, there is a second Y-axis on the right with values from 0% to 100%.

A Pareto diagram is often used in quality control to identify the most important factors.

@fig-pareto-data shows the main causes of death in the Netherlands in 2009 (source: CBS).

![Causes of death in 2009 in the Netherlands.](images/charttypes/pareto-data.png){#fig-pareto-data}

The data should be displayed in a Pareto chart, as shown in @fig-pareto-result.

![Pareto chart of death causes in 2009.](images/charttypes/pareto-result.png){#fig-pareto-result}

::: {#prp-charttype-pareto}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Chart_Pareto.xlsx`

1.  Open the file.

2.  Select any cell in the data area.

3.  Choose [Insert \> recommanded charts \> tab All Charts \> Histogram \> Pareto]{.uicontrol}.

4.  Change chart title and add data labels.
:::

## Control chart {#sec-charttype-control}

Control charts are used in statistical process control (SPC) to verify that a process variable is under control. The value of such a variable must remain within certain limits. A control chart is really nothing more than a line chart of the variable's measurements with horizontal lines for the control limits.

**Limits**

-   UCL - Upper Control Limit

-   LCL - Lower Control Limit

The control limits are calculated from the data and are set at 2-3 standard deviations from the mean, depending on the type of process. Often you will also see a horizontal line on the control chart that represents the mean. This line is referred to as CL (Central Line).

::: {#prp-charttype-control}
[File]{.smallcaps}: `Chart_Control.xlsx`

As an example, a continuous chemical process in which the temperature of the reaction mixture is monitored every hour. Proper control of this process requires that the temperature remain within 2 standard deviations from the mean.

![Control chart for the temperature in a chemical reactor.](images/charttypes/control-result.png){#fig-control-result}

1.  Open the file. The file contains a table for hour and temperature data.

2.  Enter in the cells H1 and H2 a formula for the mean and standarddeviation of the temperature data.

3.  Enter the following formulas

    -   In column CL: `=$H$1`

    -   In column UCL: `= $H$1 + 2*$H$2`

    -   In column LCL: `= $H$1 - 2*$H$2`

4.  Select all data in the table and insert a line chart with markers.

5.  Adjust the layout as desired.

## Line or Scatter Chart? {#sec-charttype-line-scatter}

Line charts and scatter charts look quite similar, especially when a scatter chart is displayed with connecting lines. However, there are important differences in the way how the data is plotted along the horizontal axis (x-axis) and the vertical axis (y-axis). So mistakes can be made easily and it's important to make the right choice.

::: {#exm-charttypes-line-scatter}
**Annual sales data**

In @fig-line-scatter, the annual sales data of a company are plotted with a line chart and a scatter chart.

![sales per year. At the left in a line chart, and at the right in a scatter chart.](images/charttypes/line-scatter.png){#fig-line-scatter}

The difference in scaling can cause incorrect conclusions. In the line chart, it looks like a strong growth in the first years and a stagnation in more recent years. This is not the case. The real growth can be seen in the scatter chart.
:::

**Line chart**

-   vertical: *value axis*
-   horizontal: *category axis*

The horizontal axis has evenly spaced categories of data (text or dates). A date axis displays dates in chronological order.

A line chart is good for displaying the change of a variable over time. Examples: sales, turnover, profit, price, etc., by day, week, month, quarter, year. The time unit is always along the horizontal axis and the value of the measured variable along the vertical axis.

**Scatter chart**

-   vertical: *value axis*
-   horizontal: *value axis*

The horizontal axis can display numeric values or date values. And you can change the scaling options of both axes. The chart displays points at the intersection of the x value and the y value.

A scatter chart is used to examine the relationship between two variables. If one variable becomes larger or smaller, what happens then with the other variable, does it become larger or smaller? The data values are displayed as separate points on the chart.

Although you can connect the points with lines, it is not a good idea, because it suggests that the changes are proceeding according to these lines. It is better to show a relationship via a trendline. This is a line that reflects the relationship between the two variables best. The measured points can be on this trend line, but usually, they are distributed around (above or below) the trend line.

Scatter charts are widely used in science and technology. In management reports, you also can find scatter charts, for example, whether there is a correlation between price increases and sales.
